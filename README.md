# eightpuzzle
Primeiro trabalho de IA, 2015/1 UFPel

This project is a simple version of the 15 Puzzle(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). It was made in Python, and the solutions chosen were the Breadth-first search(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) and the Depth-first search(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search).

To try it with a graphic interface type it in the console:

python jogo_final.py

In the first screen just click on "Iniciar"(it means "begin" in portuguese).

If you press the button S, it will show the solution through the Breadth solution. To show the solution through the Depth search, press the D button.
